## INSTRUCTION

Here, we provide an explanation of some key parameters in ```pipe/cfgs/basic.yaml``` to facilitate parameter adjustments. For more details, please refer to our paper.

- ```scene.outpaint.outpaint_extend_times``` 
  - This parameter controls the outpaint ratio of the image when constructing the global scaffold. A larger value will result in smoother scene boundaries, but it may also introduce distortion. A recommended range is between 0.3 and 0.6.
  
- ```scene.traj```
    - ```.n_sample```: This parameter controls the number of warp-and-inpaint iterations for A. The more iterations, the higher the scene integrity (fewer holes). In most cases, a value of 10 is sufficient.
    - ```.far_percentage``` / ```.traj_forward_ratio``` / ```.traj_backward_ratio``` 
      - These parameters control the range of the camera's spiral trajectory (also the final scene) in ```ops/trajs```. Directly reconstruct a quite large scene might cause distortions.
      - ```far_percentage``` controls the scale of the trajectory range. For large-scale scenes (especially those involving the sky or large windows), we recommend reducing this value. An example is in [this issue](https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/VistaDream/issues/3).
      - ```traj_forward_ratio``` and ```traj_backward_ratio``` control the forward and backward range of the camera, respectively.

- ```scene.mcs```
  - ```.steps``` means the MCS refine steps. We suggest a value between 8 and 15.
  - ```.n_view``` means the number of viewpoints optimized simultaneously in MCS. On a RTX4090 (24GB), 8 is feasible.
  - ```.rect_w``` determines the MCS control strength. We suggest 0.3-0.8.
